# USA HOUSING- Data Science Model

Welcome to the "Exploring US Home Price Trends" project repository! In this project, we embark on a data-driven 
journey to understand the key factors influencing home prices in the United States over the past two decades.
By leveraging publicly available data and advanced data science techniques, our goal is to build a comprehensive
model that sheds light on the intricate relationship between various factors and home prices.

## Feature Selection

In our analysis, we identified several key features and their correlations with the target variable, represented by the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index.

| Feature                | Correlation with Home Price Index |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| MSPUS                  | 0.980144                    |

| total_emp_cons         | 0.812130                    |
| new_private_hw_under   | 0.634935                    |
| all_Const_Emp          | 0.560479                    |
| home_ow_rate           | 0.207294                    |
| monthly_supply         | 0.169504                    |
| permit                 | 0.127189                    |
| house_st               | -0.001742                   |
| new_private_house      | -0.068468                   |

| IPI_Cement             | -0.260807                   |
| p_saving_rate          | -0.286001                   |
| emratio                | -0.538776                   |
| mortgage_rate          | -0.730709                   |
| labor_percent          | -0.788313                   |

The positive correlation values indicate a direct relationship with home prices, while negative values suggest an inverse relationship. Features with higher absolute correlation values have a larger impact on home prices.

## Model Selection and Cross-Validation

In this project, we employed the **Lasso regression** model due to indications of significant collinearity in the dataset. The Lasso regression model is known for its ability to handle collinearity by applying L1 regularization, which encourages sparsity in feature coefficients.

To optimize the Lasso model's performance and select the best regularization hyperparameter (alpha), we utilized **cross-validation**.

- Optimal alpha: **0.0576**.

The cross-validation process resulted in the following **R-squared** scores for different folds:
- Fold 1: 0.9952
- Fold 2: 0.9939
- Fold 3: 0.9933
- Fold 4: 0.9926
- Fold 5: 0.9932

- **mean R-squared** : **0.9937**
- **standard deviation R squared** : **0.0009**

## Best Features With non-zero Coefficients

Here are the features and their respective coefficients obtained from our Lasso regression model:

| Feature                | Coefficient  |
|------------------------|--------------|
| p_saving_rate          | -0.923351    |
| IPI_Cement             | 0.196152     |
| PPI_Concrete           | 16.893031    |
| population             | -8.945503    |
| new_private_hw_under   | 4.770749     |
| GDP                    | 18.499826    |
| house_st               | 2.103615     |
| labor_percent          | 1.501053     |
| all_Const_Emp          | 10.887265    |
| monthly_supply         | 3.212566     |
| unemployed_rate        | 7.251776     |
| MSPUS                  | 26.852562    |

These coefficients represent the impact of each feature on the prediction of home prices. Positive coefficients indicate a direct relationship with home prices, while negative coefficients suggest an inverse relationship.

## Features with zero Coefficient

In our analysis, some features in our Lasso regression model had coefficients of 0.0, indicating that they do not significantly impact the prediction of home prices. Here are the features with coefficients of 0.0:

| Feature               | Coefficient  |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| mortgage_rate         | 0.0          |
| PPI_Cement            | 0.0          |
| permit                | 0.0          |
| new_private_house     | 0.0          |
| emratio               | 0.0          |
| income                | 0.0          |
| home_ow_rate          | 0.0          |
| total_emp_cons        | 0.0          |

These features do not have a significant impact on the prediction of home prices in our model.
